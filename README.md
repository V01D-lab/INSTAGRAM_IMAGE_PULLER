# INSTAGRAM_IMAGE_PULLER
this program will pull any photo of off instagram using python3 by just giving it a url. Simple shit code but it works... it uses firefox so I included the geckodriver. 
I may implement a chrome version in the future... if there any issuse don't be afraid to report them on github enjoy
